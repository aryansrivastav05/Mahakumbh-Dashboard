# Mahakumbh-Dashboard
I created this interactive dashboard of Mahakumbh  in Power BI that transforms raw data into meaningful insights through visualizations, charts, and KPIs. The dashboard is designed to provide a clear, real-time view of data of kumbh mela held so  far.

1. 🌊 Mahakumbh Insights: Interactive Power BI Dashboard
    An analytical and interactive data visualization dashboard that showcases historical insights from Mahakumbh Melas held across India—focusing on year-wise          participation, locations, cultural events, infrastructure, and demographic patterns.

2. Short Description

    The Mahakumbh Insights Dashboard is a Power BI report designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the world’s largest religious gathering. It allows users      to analyze and compare different Mahakumbh Melas held so far, highlighting participant numbers, hosting cities, key rituals, and infrastructure arrangements.       This tool serves researchers, policymakers, cultural historians, and enthusiasts who seek data-driven perspectives on the event’s scale and significance.

3. Tech Stack

    The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
    • 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for dashboard creation and interactivity.
    • 📂 Power Query – For data cleaning, shaping, and transformation.
    • 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For dynamic calculations and measures (e.g., participant growth trends, year-wise comparisons).
    • 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships built between tables (events, years, cities, demographics) for cross-filtering.
    • 📁 File Formats – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4. Data Source

    Source: Compiled from publicly available records, government reports, and cultural archives on Mahakumbh Mela events.

    The dataset includes information such as:

    Years & host cities (Allahabad/Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, Nashik).

    Estimated number of pilgrims attending each Mahakumbh.

    Infrastructure & facilities (transport, security, sanitation).

    Religious rituals and key events.

    Demographic breakdown of visitors (where available).

5. Features / Highlights

    • Business Problem / Research Context
      The Mahakumbh Mela is attended by millions, but its historical scale, demographic impact, and infrastructure data are often scattered across sources. An            organized analytical dashboard helps in studying trends and drawing cultural, social, and economic insights.

    • Goal of the Dashboard
      To deliver an interactive visual platform that:

      Tracks year-wise and city-wise pilgrim participation.

      Highlights infrastructure growth and government arrangements.

      Showcases the cultural and religious significance through data.

      Helps policymakers and historians analyze trends and plan future events effectively.
